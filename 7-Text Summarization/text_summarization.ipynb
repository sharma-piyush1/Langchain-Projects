It was a unique experience for me at Khuza ma village to meet tribal \\nvillage council members and discuss with them the village progress  and the dream of \\nvillage citizens. I was very happy to see the empowered village  council functioning with \\nfinancial powers and taking decisions. I saw a prosperous village with fruits and \\nvegetables production. However, there is a need for providing physical c onnectivity in \\nNagaland through quality roads for enabling faster movement of produ cts from villages \\nto the market. That meeting gave me a powerful message about the t ransformation which \\ncan take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages a re empowered to deal \\nwith their development and are well connected among themselves and wit h the urban \\nsocieties. \\n \\nMobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness \\nNow I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai  College of \\nTechnology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas \\n(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This inc ludes \\nprovision of three connectivities - physical, electronic and knowledge  - leading to \\neconomic connectivity. Periyar PURA has health care centers, pr imary to post graduate \\nlevel education and vocational training centers. This has resulted i n large-scale \\nemployment generation and creation of number of entrepreneurs with the  active support \\nof 1000 self-help groups. Two hundred acres of waste land has been develope d into a \\ncultivable land. The villagers are busy in cultivation, planting Jatropha, herbal and \\nmedicinal plants, power generation using bio-mass, food processing and above all \\nrunning marketing centers. It provides a sustainable economic development model for the \\nwhole region. \\n \\nDuring the last eight months, people of Periyar PURA villages technologically supported \\nby Periyar Maniammai College of Engineering for Women have w orked with experts \\nfrom Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) on various products, for  which core \\ncompetence and raw material are available in Thanjavur district. They developed \\ninternationally competitive prototypes for 55 life style products wi th support of JETRO \\nspecialists and feedback from exhibitions at Delhi and Tokyo. This co -operative venture \\nhas enhanced the innovative ability of the people of all the 65 villages  enabling them to \\ndevelop and produce internationally acceptable products.

Recently, during my address to the agricultural \\nscientists while participating in a National Symposium on “Agri culture Cannot Wait”, I \\nsummarized the many practical suggestions given by farmers. W e have to double the \\nagricultural production with reduced land, reduced water resources and re duced \\nmanpower and improve the economic conditions of the nation through the principle  of \\n“Seed to Food” since agriculture is the backbone of the nation. We should em power the \\nfarmers to protect and nurture the fertile land for second green re volution.

His radiant face was revealing his happy state of mi nd. He introduced himself \\nas Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy. I greeted him and asked him  how this had \\nhappened. He smilingly said that it was from by birth. He thanked G od, his parents, \\nteachers and many others for giving him confidence, training and he lp. I asked him, what \\nI could do for him? He said, “I don’t need anything from you. I would like to sing in fr ont \\nof you”. I readily agreed. He sang melodiously the Saint Thyagraj a’s pancha ratna kriti \\nentharo mahanubavulu in Sriragam giving me a glimpse of his talent. I was quite touched. \\nWhat is the message? Despite being physically challenged, the latent talent of music \\ncould blossom in this \\nperson with his positive attitude and perseverance, encouraged by the pa rents, teachers, \\nacademics and rasikas. Now he wants to give, give and give his art to inspire others. Of \\ncourse, by his merit of music, in July 2007, he performed in the Rashtra pati Bhavan art \\ntheatre. \\n \\nOvercome the impact of disaster through partnership \\nI had the opportunity to experience the Indomitable Spirit of the people  and children of \\nJammu & Kashmir even as they were just recovering from the de vastating earthquake in \\n2005.

While various reconstruction a nd rehabilitation \\nactivities were in progress, during the discussions with the members  of tribal council, I \\nrealized the unique trait among the Car-Nicobar islanders. Even thoug h there were many \\nhuman losses due to the Tsunami of 26 Dec 2004, the tribal islanders had  taken \\npossession of affected victims as their children and there is nothi ng like orphanage in \\nCar-Nicobar Islands.

During the last \\nfive years, I had an opportunity to present colours to many regime nts, participate in \\nnumber of passing out parades, meet the troops who were going to undertake  peace \\nmissions and interact with the family members of our Defence F orces. Our Defence \\nForces are in a beautiful mission. When the nation sleeps during night , Members of our \\nDefence teams are awake to guard us and remain vigilant to counte r any threat.

The Lead India 2020 Found ation \\ncreated by Dr. N.B. Sudershan at Hyderabad is training thousands of s tudents in many \\ndistricts of Andhra Pradesh in partnership with the District Adm inistration.

It was a unique experience for me at Khuza ma village to meet tribal \\nvillage council members and discuss with them the village progress  and the dream of \\nvillage citizens. I was very happy to see the empowered village  council functioning with \\nfinancial powers and taking decisions. I saw a prosperous village with fruits and \\nvegetables production. However, there is a need for providing physical c onnectivity in \\nNagaland through quality roads for enabling faster movement of produ cts from villages \\nto the market. That meeting gave me a powerful message about the t ransformation which \\ncan take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages a re empowered to deal \\nwith their development and are well connected among themselves and wit h the urban \\nsocieties. \\n \\nMobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness \\nNow I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai  College of \\nTechnology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas \\n(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This inc ludes \\nprovision of three connectivities - physical, electronic and knowledge  - leading to \\neconomic connectivity. Periyar PURA has health care centers, pr imary to post graduate \\nlevel education and vocational training centers. This has resulted i n large-scale \\nemployment generation and creation of number of entrepreneurs with the  active support \\nof 1000 self-help groups. Two hundred acres of waste land has been develope d into a \\ncultivable land. The villagers are busy in cultivation, planting Jatropha, herbal and \\nmedicinal plants, power generation using bio-mass, food processing and above all \\nrunning marketing centers. It provides a sustainable economic development model for the \\nwhole region. \\n \\nDuring the last eight months, people of Periyar PURA villages technologically supported \\nby Periyar Maniammai College of Engineering for Women have w orked with experts \\nfrom Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) on various products, for  which core \\ncompetence and raw material are available in Thanjavur district. They developed \\ninternationally competitive prototypes for 55 life style products wi th support of JETRO \\nspecialists and feedback from exhibitions at Delhi and Tokyo. This co -operative venture \\nhas enhanced the innovative ability of the people of all the 65 villages  enabling them to \\ndevelop and produce internationally acceptable products.

As per the district authorities the impact of the  training on the students is \\nvisible in terms of self-discipline, love for their parents and tea chers shedding of stage \\nfear and recognition of their duties towards the nation. I talke d to Ms. Padma, a student \\nleader from Andhra Pradesh Tribal Welfare School, Nalgonda who relat ed how she \\nweaned her father away from smoking after imbibing the spirit of  the 10 point oath from \\nthe Lead India Training Camp. This gives me an assurance that the  youth of our country \\nare on the right path \\nthrough this mission oriented programme. With the ignited minds of the  540 million \\nyouth below the age of 25, which I consider is the most powerful resour ce on the earth, \\nunder the earth and above the earth, we have to empower the youth through va lue based \\neducation and leadership. \\n \\nConclusion \\nI was touched by the variety of Indian panorama, emotional content of  the tune, cultural \\ndiversity and unity of minds in the vast land of ours. I have cited thes e examples just to \\ngive a glimpse of the richness of our tradition and effort being taken by different agencies'),\n",

      "\n",
      "He also shares a personal anecdote about a question from a young girl, Anukriti, who asked why India couldn't become a developed nation before 2020. Dr. Kalam was inspired by her question and assured her that India could achieve this goal with the right efforts and aspirations.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker appreciated the question and assured the person that they will take their dream to the highest institution of the nation and work towards it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech emphasizes the need for India's youth to strive for a prosperous, safe, and proud India. The speaker highlights the aspirations of the 540 million youth in the country, who want to live in a developed India. \n",
      "\n",
      "The speech also focuses on empowering villages in India, citing a personal experience of visiting a village in Nagaland where the village council was functioning with financial powers and taking decisions. The speaker believes that empowering all 600,000 villages in India can lead to transformation and better development.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, the speech mentions the initiative of Periyar Maniammai College of Technology for Women, which has implemented the Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas (PURA) complex in 65 villages. This initiative aims to provide physical, electronic, and knowledge connectivity, leading to economic connectivity, and has resulted in large-scale employment generation and the creation of entrepreneurs.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech highlights the successful implementation of a project called Periyar PURA (Protsahan for Uplifting Rural Ability) in a region. The project has achieved several goals:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Employment generation and creation of entrepreneurs with the support of 1000 self-help groups.\n",
      "2. Development of 200 acres of waste land into cultivable land.\n",
      "3. Villagers are engaged in various activities such as cultivation, planting, power generation, food processing, and marketing.\n",
      "\n",
      "The project has also collaborated with experts from Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) and Periyar Maniammai College of Engineering for Women, resulting in the development of 55 internationally competitive lifestyle products.\n",

      "The speech emphasizes the potential of similar projects to bridge the rural-urban divide and suggests that 7000 more such projects are needed to achieve this goal.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech is about the speaker's enriching experiences meeting farmers and people from different backgrounds. The key points of the speech are:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The speaker met over 6,000 farmers from various states and union territories at Rashtrapati Bhavan, who showed interest in the gardens and interacted with horticultural specialists.\n",
      "2. The speaker emphasized the need to double agricultural production with reduced resources and improve the nation's economic conditions through the principle of \"Seed to Food\", as agriculture is the backbone of the nation.\n",
      "3. The speaker expressed confidence that the nation can increase agricultural GDP growth by at least 4% per annum through the partnership of farmers, scientists, and industries for value addition.\n",
      "4. The speaker then shared a personal experience of meeting a man named Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy, who was born without hands and legs but had a radiant and happy spirit.\n",
      "5. Krishna Murthy's story inspired the speaker, and he was asked what he could do for him. Krishna Murthy replied that he didn't need anything from him, but wanted to sing in front of him, which he did.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech ends with a message of \"Defeat the problems and succeed\", implying that one should not let their circumstances hold them back and should strive to overcome obstacles.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech appears to be about the author's experiences with two individuals who overcame adversity.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first story is about a person with physical challenges who possesses a hidden talent for music. Despite his limitations, he was encouraged by his parents, teachers, and others, and eventually developed his skills to the point where he performed on stage, including at the Rashtra Pati Bhavan art theatre in 2007.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second story is about the people of Urusa village in Jammu & Kashmir, who were affected by a devastating earthquake in 2005. However, instead of letting the disaster defeat them, the villagers banded together and worked with the Army, Air Force, and state government to overcome their problems. The author praises their courage and resilience, saying that they have become \"the master of the problem rather than allowing the problem to become their master.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The overall message of the speech seems to be about the importance of perseverance, partnership, and resilience in overcoming adversity.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech appears to be about the courage and resilience of citizens in the face of natural disasters and calamities. The speaker mentions two specific instances:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. A visit to a village after an earthquake, where residents, including children, participated in relief efforts and were smiling despite their situation. The speaker also witnessed the settlement of relief grants to victims whose houses were damaged.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. A visit to the Car Nicobar Islands after the 2004 Tsunami, where the tribal islanders showed remarkable courage and resilience. Despite losing many people, they took in the affected victims as their own and showed no signs of orphanages. The speaker was moved by their bravery and composed a poem called \"Sea Waves\" which they sang together.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech also touches on the importance of connectivity for societal transformation, mentioning an address to the Pan African Parliament in 2004, but this part is not fully included in the provided summary.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech mentions a proposal for a Pan African e-Network, a connectivity project aiming to link 53 African countries through satellite, fiber optics, and wireless networks at an estimated cost of $100 million. \n",
      "\n",
      "The project involves connecting:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. 12 universities (7 from India and 5 from Africa) \n",
      "2. 17 Super Specialty Hospitals (12 from India and 5 from Africa) \n",
      "3. 53 tele-medicine centers \n",
      "4. 53 tele-education centers in Africa\n",
      "\n",
      "A pilot project in Ethiopia has already been implemented, enabling Ethiopian students to take an MBA course through the Indira Gandhi National Open University, and also allowing specialists from a hospital in India to provide tele-medicine services in Africa.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech appears to be by the President of India, but the full name of the President is not specified in the given speech. \n",
      "\n",
      "The speech highlights three main points:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. India's contribution to Africa: The President mentions that India has been providing one-hour live tele-consultation services to doctors in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, since 2006. This is part of India's efforts to bring technological benefits to African countries and promote societal transformation.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Defending the nation: The President expresses pride in the Indian Armed Forces, particularly during visits to Siachen Glacier, INS Sindhurakshak, and experiencing a Sukhoi-30 fighter. The President emphasizes the dedication and vigilance of the Defence Forces in guarding the nation and protecting its citizens.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Youth movement for a Developed India 2020: The President mentions a group in Hyderabad who are working to transform the youth into enlightened citizens, and possibly connects this initiative to his vision for a Developed India 2020.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker discusses the transformation of youth into enlightened citizens through the Lead India 2020 Foundation, a program initiated by Dr. N.B. Sudershan in Hyderabad. Specifically, the speaker highlights the positive impact of the program on students in the Medak district of Andhra Pradesh, citing improvements in self-discipline, respect for parents and teachers, and a reduction in stage fear.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker shares a personal anecdote from a student leader, Ms. Padma, who credited the program with helping her change her father's habits, including quitting smoking. This gives the speaker confidence that the program is on the right path.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech concludes with the speaker emphasizing the potential of India's youth (540 million below the age of 25) as the most powerful resource, and the need to empower them through value-based education and leadership. The speaker also mentions the diversity and unity of India, highlighting the richness of its traditions and the efforts of various agencies in promoting these values.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech emphasizes the importance of preserving India's rich cultural and natural heritage while pursuing economic growth. The speaker believes that this can be achieved through countrywide participation and the empowerment of the youth. They highlight the progress India has made in the last sixty years and the potential of its 540 million youth.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker expresses their confidence in India's ability to become a developed nation by 2020 and encourages the youth to aim high, citing a famous poem that suggests that their dreams can come true. They then outline a distinctive profile for a developed India:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. A reduction in the rural-urban divide\n",
      "2. Equitable access to energy and quality water\n",
      "3. A harmonious relationship between agriculture, industry, and the service sector\n",
      "4. Education with a value system available to all meritorious candidates, regardless of societal or economic discrimination\n",
      "5. India as the best destination for talented scholars, scientists, and investors.\n",
      "\n",
      "The overall tone of the speech is optimistic and encouraging, with a focus on working together to achieve a developed India.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech describes an ideal vision for the nation, focusing on key areas:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Universal access to high-quality healthcare.\n",
      "2. A responsive, transparent, and corruption-free governance system.\n",
      "3. A society where poverty is eradicated, education is widespread, and crimes against women and children are nonexistent.\n",
      "4. A prosperous, secure, peaceful, and happy nation with sustainable growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech, given by Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam, President of India, consists of the following key points:\n",
      "\n",

He recalls a visit to the Car Nicobar Islands after the 2004 tsunami, where he saw the Tribal Council Leaders and islanders coming together to support each other. Inspired by their resilience, Kalam composed a poem called \"Sea Waves\" which was sung with him by the islanders, showcasing their courage and enthusiasm.\n",

      "Kalam also emphasized the importance of connectivity for societal transformation. He addressed the Pan African Parliament in 2004, highlighting the potential for Africa to overcome its challenges through collaboration and partnership. His vision for a connected and prosperous India is evident in his emphasis on bridging the rural-urban divide through initiatives like the Periyar PURA project. Notably, Kalam proposed the concept of Pan African e-Network, a $100 million project that aims to connect 53 African countries through a seamless and integrated satellite, fiber optics, and wireless network. This project includes connecting 12 universities, 17 Super Specialty Hospitals, 53 tele-medicine centers, and 53 tele-education centers in Africa, with the goal of promoting education, healthcare, and economic growth.\n",

      "Furthermore, Kalam's commitment to national security and defense is evident in his interactions with members of the Indian Armed Forces, Para-Military Forces, and Central and State Police personnel.

      "The Lead India 2020 Foundation, an initiative created by Dr. N.B. Sudershan at Hyderabad, is training thousands of students in various districts of Andhra Pradesh in partnership with the District Administration. The foundation's mission-oriented program has transformed students by instilling self-discipline, a love for their parents and teachers, and a recognition of their duties towards the nation. Kalam was inspired by the transformation of a student leader, Ms. Padma, who weaned her father away from smoking after imbibing the spirit of the 10-point oath from the Lead India Training Camp.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the 540 million youth below the age of 25, which Kalam considers the most powerful resource on the earth, he emphasizes the importance of empowering them through value-based education and leadership. Kalam's vision for a developed India is one where every village is a hub of economic growth and prosperity, and his message of hope and inspiration to the youth of India will continue to inspire future generations. He emphasizes the importance of partnerships, collaboration, and determination in achieving India's development goals and overcoming adversity.\n",

      "Kalam's emphasis on empowering the youth and rural communities is also evident in his interactions with farmers and agricultural scientists.
